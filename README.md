<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
  It has been observed that whenever something is lost on campus, we often have to run to the Lost and Found department and look for it, only to find out later that the item arrived after our visit. To tackle this problem, a web app can provide helpful information. The Lost and Found WebApp will have a simple and elegant design. Users will be greeted with a login page, followed by two options: finding a lost item or reporting a found item that belongs to someone else. Multiple item categories will be available, including ID cards, mobile phones, wallets, ATM cards, notebooks, and more. When reporting a found item, users can choose to identify themselves or remain anonymous. They can also provide contact information if they wish to be contacted by the owner, or they can submit the item to the Lost and Found department for the owner to claim it from there. Owners can verify their identity and claim their lost items.
</p>

<p>
  The web app will be built using ReactJS and MongoDB as the database. The final app will be containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS EC2.
