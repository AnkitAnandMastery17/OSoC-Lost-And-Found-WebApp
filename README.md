## About the Project
It has been observed that when we misplace items on campus, we often find ourselves making repeated trips to the Lost and Found department, sometimes only to discover the item arriving there after our initial visit. To address this issue, a user-friendly web application would be incredibly beneficial. This application will boast a simple and elegant design, comprising a login page and two primary options: "Find a Lost Item" or "Report a Found Item Belonging to Someone Else."  
> The web app will be built using React JS and MongoDB as a database. The final app will be containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS EC2.

## Uniqueness Of The Project
- *University Focus* -> It is designed specifically for use by university students, faculty and staff. This allows it to be tailored to the needs of a campus environment.
- *Centralized Platform* -> Provides one unified place to report and search for lost/found items across an entire university campus. Eliminates the need for scattered bulletin boards.
- *User Profiles* -> Registered users can manage a profile with their lost/found history and contact info. Enables accountability.
- *Focus on Reuniting* -> Priority is reuniting owners with their lost items when possible. Enables anonymous finding.

## Who Can Use The Product
- *Students* -> Can report lost items like phones, bags, keys, books etc. And search for their lost items that someone else found and reported.
- *Faculty & Staff* -> Can report lost/found items. Useful for things like lost laptops, employee badges, wallets, etc.
